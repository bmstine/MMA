                 <h3>Benefits of Membership</h3>
                 <p>By far the biggest benefit of membership is the opportunity to join our corps of volunteers. The wide range of opportunities has something for almost anyone. Meet interesting people working in teams, or work alone on "backroom" projects. Meet the public, or work behind the scenes. Work as a leader or a follower.  Do one thing, or many things. Some of us work one three hour shift per month as docents in our buildings, while for others, the museum is a second home. Try whatever interests you. If it turns out to be wrong for you, there is no pressure to continue. Go ahead and try something else. Training is provided where appropriate. Areas of interest include:</p>
          <h4>Docents </h4>
          <p> Tour guides for the Stationmaster's House, Passenger and Freight Stations, and the Frankenberger Tavern. This can be one three hour shift per month or more. You agree to your assignment the month before, and can change with another docent if necessary.</p>
          <h4>Educational Program</h4>
          <p>Volunteers guide 4th grade classes as docents in several buildings for morning sessions during Spring and Fall.</p>

                    The Mechanicsburg Museum Association was founded in 1975 in a community effort to preserve the Stationmaster’s House, a historic Mechanicsburg landmark, from destruction. Since its founding, the Association has preserved and promoted Mechanicsburg’s unique history with educational programs, gallery exhibits, and by acquiring four more historic buildings in the area.
